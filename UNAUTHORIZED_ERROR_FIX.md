# Unauthorized Error Fix - BlueBoxy App

## Problem
The app was showing "Unauthorized after 2.4ms" errors because it was trying to make API calls to backend endpoints that don't exist yet or require authentication.

## Root Cause
The `EnhancedActivitiesViewModel` was automatically making API calls to:
- `/api/activities/personalized` - for personalized recommendations
- `/api/activities/search` - for activity search
- `/api/activities/{id}/save` - for bookmarking activities

These endpoints either don't exist on your backend yet or require proper authentication setup.

## Solution
Added a **fallback mode** to the `EnhancedActivitiesViewModel` that:
1. **Disables all API calls** when `useFallbackMode = true`
2. **Uses mock data** instead of real API responses
3. **Provides a seamless user experience** while you develop the backend

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Fallback Mode Configuration
```swift
/// Fallback mode - set to true to disable backend API calls until your backend is ready
private let useFallbackMode = true // TODO: Set to false when backend APIs are implemented
```

### 2. Modified API-calling Methods
- `loadActivitiesFromNetwork()` - Uses mock data when in fallback mode
- `loadPersonalizedRecommendations()` - Skipped when in fallback mode
- `searchActivities()` - Uses local filtering when in fallback mode
- `toggleBookmark()` - Only saves locally when in fallback mode
- `refineRecommendations()` - Skipped when in fallback mode

### 3. Added Mock Data
Created a `loadMockActivities()` function that provides sample activities:
- Romantic Dinner at Sunset Bistro
- Art Gallery Walk  
- Hiking Trail Adventure

## Using the Fix

### Current State (Development)
- Set `useFallbackMode = true` (already done)
- App works with mock data, no API calls made
- No unauthorized errors

### When Your Backend is Ready
1. Implement the required API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/activities` - List activities
   - `GET /api/activities/personalized` - Get personalized recommendations
   - `POST /api/activities/search` - Search activities
   - `POST /api/activities/{id}/save` - Save/bookmark activity
   - `DELETE /api/activities/{id}/save` - Remove bookmark

2. Set up proper authentication in your backend

3. Change the configuration:
   ```swift
   private let useFallbackMode = false // Enable real API calls
   ```

4. Test the integration

## API Endpoints You Need to Implement

### Authentication Required Endpoints
```
GET    /api/activities/personalized?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&preferences={prefs}
POST   /api/activities/search
POST   /api/activities/{id}/save  
DELETE /api/activities/{id}/save
POST   /api/activities/refine
```

### Public Endpoints  
```
GET    /api/activities
GET    /api/activities/{id}
```

## Expected Request/Response Formats
The app expects these response formats (see `BackendModels.swift` for details):
- `ActivitiesResponse` - List of activities
- `ActivitySearchResponse` - Search results with insights
- `PersonalizedActivityResponse` - Personalized recommendations

## Benefits of This Approach
✅ **No more unauthorized errors**  
✅ **App works immediately** with realistic mock data  
✅ **Easy to switch** to real API when ready  
✅ **Preserves all integration code** for future use  
✅ **User can test UI/UX** without backend dependency

## Next Steps
1. Develop your backend API endpoints
2. Test each endpoint individually  
3. Disable fallback mode when ready
4. Test end-to-end integration

The mock data provides a realistic preview of how the app will work with real data, so you can continue UI development and testing while building your backend.
