# Grok AI Integration Setup

Your BlueBoxy app is now configured to use **Grok AI** for generating real activity recommendations instead of mock data!

## ü§ñ What's Changed

- **Real AI-powered recommendations**: Activities are now generated by Grok AI based on user preferences, location, personality types, and relationship dynamics
- **Dynamic content**: Every time you open the Activities tab, you'll get fresh, personalized suggestions
- **Intelligent matching**: Grok AI considers personality types, love languages, and relationship duration for better matches
- **Fallback system**: If Grok AI fails, the app gracefully falls back to mock data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Development)
1. Get your **XAI API key** from [x.ai](https://console.x.ai/)
2. Add it to your environment:
   ```bash
   export XAI_API_KEY="your-actual-xai-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Restart Xcode and rebuild the app

### Option 2: Keychain (Recommended for Production)
1. Get your XAI API key
2. Add it to the app's keychain programmatically:
   ```swift
   let success = KeychainHelper.shared.save(
       service: "BlueBoxy", 
       account: "xai_api_key", 
       data: "your-actual-xai-api-key-here"
   )
   ```

### Option 3: Development Placeholder (Testing Only)
For quick testing, you can temporarily replace the placeholder in `Environment.swift`:
```swift
// In XAIConfig.apiKey, replace:
return "xai-dev-key-placeholder" 
// With your actual key:
return "your-actual-xai-api-key-here"
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit real API keys to version control!**

## üéØ How It Works

1. **User opens Activities tab** ‚Üí App calls Grok AI with user context
2. **Grok AI analyzes** personality type, relationship stage, location, preferences
3. **AI generates personalized activities** like "Romantic sunset dinner at [local restaurant]"
4. **Activities display** with AI-generated descriptions, costs, tips, and alternatives
5. **Smart caching** prevents excessive API calls (30-minute cache)

## üìä What Grok AI Considers

- **Personality Types**: Tailors activities to user's psychological profile
- **Love Languages**: Matches activities to how users express/receive love
- **Relationship Duration**: Suggests appropriate intimacy levels
- **Location & Season**: Finds local, seasonally appropriate activities
- **Preferences**: Uses stated ideal activities and interests
- **Communication Style**: Considers how couples interact

## üîß Configuration Options

In `EnhancedActivitiesViewModel.swift`:

```swift
// Enable/disable AI generation
private let useGrokAI = true  // Set to false to disable AI

// Control fallback behavior
private let useFallbackMode = true  // For backend API calls
```

## üß™ Testing

1. **With API Key**: You'll see console logs like "ü§ñ Loading activities from Grok AI..." followed by "‚úÖ Loaded X activities from Grok AI"

2. **Without API Key**: You'll see "‚ö†Ô∏è Grok AI API key not configured" and the app falls back to mock data

3. **Categories**: Try changing categories in the Activities tab - Grok AI will generate different activities for each category

## üìù Console Output

Watch the debug console for:
- `ü§ñ Loading activities from Grok AI...` - AI request started
- `‚úÖ Loaded X activities from Grok AI` - Success 
- `‚ùå Grok AI failed: [error]` - API failure (falls back to mock data)
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Grok AI API key not configured` - Setup needed

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Get your XAI API key** and configure it
2. **Test different scenarios**: Try changing user preferences, location, categories
3. **Monitor costs**: Each activity generation uses ~1000-2000 tokens
4. **Customize prompts**: Modify the system prompt in `GrokAIService.swift` to fine-tune output

## üí° Pro Tips

- **User profiles**: The better the user's personality assessment, the better the AI recommendations
- **Location services**: Enable location for more relevant local activities  
- **Category filtering**: Use categories to get focused recommendations
- **Refresh**: Pull to refresh to get new AI-generated activities

Your app now provides truly personalized, AI-generated activity recommendations that adapt to each user's unique preferences and relationship dynamics! üéâ
