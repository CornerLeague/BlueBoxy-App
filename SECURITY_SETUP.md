# 🔐 BlueBoxy Security Setup Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

You previously shared sensitive API keys publicly. **These keys are now compromised and must be regenerated immediately.**

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Regenerate ALL API Keys
**Do this RIGHT NOW:**

1. **OpenAI API Key**: 
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Delete the old key: `sk-proj-gSN3_D-YurdGawfG2gQ041tq...`
   - Generate a new one

2. **XAI API Key**:
   - Go to your XAI dashboard
   - Delete the old key: `xai-l79UmiOLNzOPuyeHYJwnzs6bw...`
   - Generate a new one

3. **Database**:
   - Change your Neon database password
   - Update connection settings

### 2. Secure Storage Setup

Your project now uses **secure keychain storage** instead of plain text files.

#### Set Up Development Keys Securely

```bash
cd /Users/newmac/Desktop/BlueBoxy
./setup_dev_keys.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Store keys in macOS Keychain (encrypted)
- ✅ Keep keys out of version control
- ✅ Allow secure access by your app

## 🏗️ How the Secure System Works

### Configuration Files (Safe to commit)

**Debug.xcconfig** & **Release.xcconfig**:
- ✅ Only non-sensitive configuration
- ✅ Base URLs, feature flags
- ✅ Safe to version control

**Info.plist files**:
- ✅ Only references to xcconfig variables
- ✅ No sensitive data
- ✅ Safe to version control

### Secure Key Access (Environment.swift)

Your app now gets API keys from:
1. **Keychain** (most secure) 
2. **Environment variables** (for server deployment)
3. **Development placeholders** (debug builds only)

```swift
// Example usage in your app:
let openAIKey = Environment.openAIConfig.apiKey
let baseURL = Environment.baseURL
```

## 📁 File Security Status

| File | Security Status | Contains |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `Environment.swift` | ✅ Secure | Key access logic only |
| `Debug.xcconfig` | ✅ Safe | Non-sensitive config |
| `Release.xcconfig` | ✅ Safe | Non-sensitive config |
| `Info-Debug.plist` | ✅ Safe | References to xcconfig |
| `Info-Release.plist` | ✅ Safe | References to xcconfig |
| `setup_dev_keys.sh` | ✅ Secure | Keychain storage script |

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. Run `./setup_dev_keys.sh` to store your new API keys
2. Keys are encrypted in Keychain
3. App automatically reads from Keychain

### Daily Development
- No need to manage keys manually
- Keys stay secure and out of git
- Different keys for debug/release if needed

### Team Collaboration
- Team members run their own `setup_dev_keys.sh`
- Everyone uses their own API keys
- No shared secrets in code

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production (when you deploy to App Store):
- Keys are retrieved from secure server environment variables
- Never embedded in the app binary
- App connects to your backend API, not directly to OpenAI/XAI

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **No secrets in version control**
✅ **Encrypted keychain storage**  
✅ **Environment-based configuration**
✅ **Separate debug/release configs**
✅ **No hardcoded credentials**
✅ **Secure development workflow**

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

After running `./setup_dev_keys.sh`:

1. **Build your app** - should compile without errors
2. **Check configuration**:
   ```swift
   Environment.printConfigurationStatus()
   // Should show "OpenAI configured: true"
   ```
3. **Verify keychain storage**:
   ```bash
   security find-generic-password -s BlueBoxy -a openai_api_key
   # Should find the password (without displaying it)
   ```

## 🆘 If You Need to Reset

Remove all stored keys:
```bash
security delete-generic-password -s BlueBoxy -a openai_api_key
security delete-generic-password -s BlueBoxy -a xai_api_key  
security delete-generic-password -s BlueBoxy -a session_secret
```

Then run `./setup_dev_keys.sh` again.

## 📋 What Changed From Your Original Setup

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Keys in Info.plist | ✅ Keys in Keychain |
| ❌ Plain text secrets | ✅ Encrypted storage |
| ❌ Committed to git | ✅ Local only |
| ❌ Publicly visible | ✅ Secure access |
| ❌ Single config file | ✅ Environment-specific |

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Regenerate your API keys** (most important!)
2. **Run** `./setup_dev_keys.sh` with new keys
3. **Test your app build**
4. **Never share API keys again** - use this secure system

Your app is now configured with enterprise-grade security practices! 🎉

**Remember**: The old keys you shared are compromised. Regenerate them immediately before continuing development.
